# RestoreCord

## New to RestoreCord?

RestoreCord is a Discord recovery service, that allows you to restore your Discord guild (along with settings & members) after being nuked, raided, or otherwise lost. It's simple, easy to use, and reliable since 2020.

## Where can I use RestoreCord?

RestoreCord has multiple use cases:

- Verification service
- Server backup & restore
- Transfer members between the Old and New server
- Light alternate account detection

## How does RestoreCord work?

RestoreCord uses Discord's [OAuth2](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2){ target="_blank" } feature which gives users the ability to add Applications/Bots to their accounts. With special permissions, RestoreCord can “pull” users to specified servers. This WILL NOT grant anyone access to your account and WILL NOT steal your account token/email/password. RestoreCord is entirely safe.
