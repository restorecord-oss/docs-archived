Due to security reason, we highly recommend you taking these steps before bringing your custom bot to production.

## Security checklist
Priority   | Suggestion | Description
:---:   | :---: | :---:
[!badge variant="danger" text="HIGH"] | Create an Application Team  | Add your bot to an application team. 
[!badge variant="danger" text="HIGH"] | Multiple team members  | Invite as many accounts in your team as you can, incase you lose access to your bot, you will still have access to your Discord Bot.
[!badge variant="warning" text="MEDIUM"] | Use a VPN | To prevent Discord banning all of your accounts using the same IP Address, avoid using any free VPNs/Proxies.
[!badge variant="warning" text="MEDIUM"] | Use an appropriate bot name | Please **DO NOT** try to impersonate other popular Bots such as MEE6, Dyno, Wick or even RestoreCord, these names might get flagged by Discord which would eventually lead to a Bot deletion.
<!-- [!badge variant="success" text="MEDIUM"] | Use a custom domain | If you own a domain, we recommend you using Cloudflare Pages Rules to redirect your domain to our domain. Here is a tutorial on how to setup Cloudflare Page rules with RestoreCord. -->
