!!!warning Was your bot banned?
Was your bot or the account that owned your bot banned? If so, it will be impossible to restore your members. Server settings can still be restored but members are linked to a bot and can't be moved to another bot.

This is why it's imperative you follow our guide to keeping your bot safe. View below.

Your server was just banned/deleted? How do we restore our members and settings? Read below.

Navigate to the `Servers` tab of the [dashboard](https://restorecord.com/dashboard/server){ target="_blank" }

Click the **Edit** button for the server that was just banned or deleted. Follow the below guide to update the **Guild ID (also called Server ID)**, and **Member Role ID** fields.

Once these settings are set, click the **Save Changes** button at the bottom of the page.

### Restore your members

Upon completing the above setting changes, click the **Migrate** button on the `Servers` tab of the [dashboard](https://restorecord.com/dashboard/server){ target="_blank" }

This will initiate pulling your members to the set server. You may close your browser and RestoreCord will keep pulling. Be patient, it may take a while due to Discord rate limits. 

You can view a log of members being pulled if you enable System Messages in your Discord server.
